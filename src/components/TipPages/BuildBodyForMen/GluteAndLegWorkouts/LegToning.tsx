                    Leg toning is crucial for overall body balance, muscle symmetry, and functional movement. Strong legs support daily activities, reduce the risk of injuries, and help you perform better in sports or physical tasks. Additionally, toning your legs helps to improve posture and boosts metabolism, contributing to fat loss and lean muscle development.
